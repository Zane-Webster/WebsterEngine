# WEBSTER ENGINE
**3D Physics and Rendering Engine**

*Version 1.0.0*

## ABOUT
WebsterEngine is a real time 3D engine written in C++ using OpenGL, SDL3, GLAD and GLM.

The project was built to explore graphics programming, physics simulation, and engine architecture using industry-standard libraries and low-level systems design.

WebsterEngine supports 3D model rendering, texture rendering, lighting, raycasting, shadows, collision detection, and physics resolution, providing a foundation for game development and simulation environments.

Developed independently by Caleb Zane Webster as a software and graphics programming project.
